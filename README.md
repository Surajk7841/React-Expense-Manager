## Description 
The "Expenses" project, built using React.js, is a user-friendly web application that enables efficient expense management. Users can input their expenses via a form, view them in a list, and sort them by year (e.g., 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023). When adding expenses, users can specify the date, month, and year. Notably, the application offers a visual representation of monthly expenses through bar charts for each selected year, helping users quickly identify spending patterns by visualizing high and low expenses in each month from January to December, thus facilitating effective financial tracking and planning.
